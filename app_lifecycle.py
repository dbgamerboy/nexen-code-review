"""One application lifespan for NEXEN's ordered, paired worker hooks.

Registering a hook never starts recovery or a worker. Shutdown runs in reverse
order, including after a later startup fails. A hook whose startup itself fails
must unwind its own partial acquisition. Legacy router event pairs (currently
task_scene) are captured in their original registration order, not run twice.
